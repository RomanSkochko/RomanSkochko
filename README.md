👨‍💻 **About me**  
I’m a Java Software Engineer with hands-on experience in building REST APIs using Java, Spring Boot, Hibernate, PostgreSQL, Docker, and other modern backend tools

---

### 🚀 Projects

- **🚖 Taxi Booking REST API** — Designed and implemented backend for a taxi service using Java 21, Spring Boot 3.4.0, PostgreSQL, Redis, and MapStruct.  
- **📦 Freight Transportation Platform** — Contributed as a volunteer backend developer to build MVP for logistics platform.

---

### 🌱 What drives me

- **Before the code, there is the blueprint.** I believe that clear thinking and system design are the true spells behind stable software.  
- **Chess sharpens the architect’s mind.** It teaches patience, foresight, and how to see what others miss.  
   *Care to learn how to win before the game even begins?*  
- **Wandering alone is fine, but building together is better.** Let’s connect — every conversation is a chance to create something meaningful.
